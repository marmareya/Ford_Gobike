## Summary of Findings

> The age outliers reached over 120 years, and since the majority of users are at the age between 20 and 57 years old with mean 35 years old, I removed the data of users over 60.
> Thursdays are the highest in bikes usage, while Saturdays and Sundays are the least, which makes sense because Saturdays and Sundays are holidays.
The time slot around 8 am and 5 pm are the highest usage times since they are the time of going/leaving work.
What is unusual is that the dataset was only abount month february of year 2019.
> First of all, we could observe that the bike system is mainly used by subscribers, though both of the subscribers and customers followed the almost the same weekday and hourly pattern of bike trips. Moreover, we found that customers trips durations are longer than subscribers.
> We observed the differnce in the trip duration between customers and subscribers, that customers trips are longer than for subscribers, probably because they are tourests, while the subscribers on the other hand use the system mainly for daily purposes and quick rides to and from work/school.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The biggest insight was the pattern of the two types of riders (customers and subscribers) when compared to the same days and day hours.
